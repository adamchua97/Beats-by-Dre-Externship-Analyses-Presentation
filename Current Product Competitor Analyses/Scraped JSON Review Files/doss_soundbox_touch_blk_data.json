Also, even if I'm right by the speaker with the cell phone, if I start to use other apps, it gives static sound to the music.2. When I get a call and pick up while music is playing from the app on my phone, I have an issue. After the call, when I start to play the music again and try to connect Bluetooth from my cell phone, the speaker had already been turned off after like 5 minutes of inactivity. So, I have to go over to the speaker, touch the back of the speaker to find the tiny little power button to turn on the power again.Bass could have been better, but it is not so bad. It has pretty good bass compared to playing music on the cellphone. But the sound overall isn't very clear--it sort of have the closed sound.

To this day, it is still going strong and has yet to malfunction at any point - still perfect for bringing to the park or the beach, and still my go-to for listening to music while I do dishes or cook.Is the sound quality on par with a speaker from Bose or JBL? Of course not - that would be silly to expect from a speaker this low in cost. But it’s darn good for the price, and the lifespan has honestly been shocking. If you’re looking for an affordable Bluetooth speaker that is easy to use, reliable, and can withstand being dropped or getting wet, I recommend giving this one a try.
