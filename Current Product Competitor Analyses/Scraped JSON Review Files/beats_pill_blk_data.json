It fills a room but does distort slightly at max volume so I would keep it at 75% maximum for best sound. Battery also shortens at louder volumes, I've found it to last around 1 week with moderate use, but def not the 24 hours as promised. The bass is good but it sounds the best only with a wall behind it or on a flat surface pointing outwards. The controls are kinda annoying, as pairing new devices was kinda a hassle.

While it doesn’t deliver the deep rumbling bass of larger speakers, it still offers a well-balanced sound profile that’s perfect for personal use or small gatherings.It works great on a bike too because its so small and lightweight. Its easy to carry around, whether you’re tossing it in your bag or using the included strap to hang it from your backpack.
