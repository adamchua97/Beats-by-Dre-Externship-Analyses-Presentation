It’s been my absolute favorite speaker. I’ve loved it even more than brand new ones. Yesterday it just out of no where stopped working. I’ve charged it up all day & the blue light blinks on no sound comes out anymore. My husband and I have done everything possibly we could try to get it back working but no luck and no I don’t see how the speakers could have blown because it was not even being used (far as sound being disturbed through it when it stopped working). I guess we will just have to throw it out but I’m very sad as it’s not a cheap speaker and I have absolutely loved it for the last 2 years.

If you also pay $27, it's a good speaker, but it's worse in several ways than the previous one. It doesn't get as loud, the battery doesn't last as long, and it has an auto shut off that is very annoying. The speaker takes a good 10 seconds to actually start working after connecting, and mutes for a second after unpausing something.The only things that seem improved are *very* slightly better sound quality, that horrific blue light is gone, and it's a better charging port. Which is good, since you'll be plugging it in more frequently.If you have not experienced the previous model, you'll probably like this one. I would never pay full price ($45) for it, though.

I didn't trust them enough, so I refused their offer.
