It fills a room but does distort slightly at max volume so I would keep it at 75% maximum for best sound. Battery also shortens at louder volumes, I've found it to last around 1 week with moderate use, but def not the 24 hours as promised. The bass is good but it sounds the best only with a wall behind it or on a flat surface pointing outwards. The controls are kinda annoying, as pairing new devices was kinda a hassle.

I will not tell you that this is the same as listening through a larger system, but I can actually listen to a symphony, like Dvorak's eighth, without cringing. On pieces with less complicated instrumentation it does even better, Bass response is very good for a small speaker.ONE IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure you upgrade the firmware.
