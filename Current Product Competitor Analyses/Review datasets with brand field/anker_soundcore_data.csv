R16X27QVDPDFD0,B01MTB55WH,anker,3.0 out of 5 stars Great Speaker but not long life span,Kerry Deloach,3,I’ve had this Anker speaker for about 2 years now. It’s been my absolute favorite speaker. I’ve loved it even more than brand new ones. Yesterday it just out of no where stopped working. I’ve charged it up all day & the blue light blinks on no sound comes out anymore. My husband and I have done everything possibly we could try to get it back working but no luck and no I don’t see how the speakers could have blown because it was not even being used (far as sound being disturbed through it when it stopped working). I guess we will just have to throw it out but I’m very sad as it’s not a cheap speaker and I have absolutely loved it for the last 2 years.

R19P3FU5DOT34J,B01MTB55WH,anker,3.0 out of 5 stars Just ok,Mattie M.,3,"I got this for $27 after Amazon informed me of a recall on the previous model. If you also pay $27, it's a good speaker, but it's worse in several ways than the previous one. It doesn't get as loud, the battery doesn't last as long, and it has an auto shut off that is very annoying. The speaker takes a good 10 seconds to actually start working after connecting, and mutes for a second after unpausing something.The only things that seem improved are *very* slightly better sound quality, that horrific blue light is gone, and it's a better charging port. Which is good, since you'll be plugging it in more frequently.If you have not experienced the previous model, you'll probably like this one. I would never pay full price ($45) for it, though.

I intended to use the Anker Soundcore 2 speaker with my electronic drumkit, I connected the audio output of my drumkit to the Aux input of the Soundcore 2 speaker, the sound is good but it has a noticeable and unbearable delay (latency) of several miliseconds, you can hear it in the attached video.I contacted Anker's support and they offered to send me a replacement unit that, according to them, this time should work fine, Their offer came with two conditions: I had to send my unit back to them for review and inspection, and I had to tolerate a different color on the replacement unit, because they don't have stock units in the color that I like. I didn't trust them enough, so I refused their offer. I am extremely disappointed and not pleased at all with this product's performance.I do not recommend Anker Soundcore 2 speaker for latency-free use, either via Aux input or Bluetooth.

This speaker is fantastic. It has very good, robust sound quality. Great volume. The instructions were a bit cryptic. Just a few pictures. But I figured it out.

R16X27QVDPDFD0,B09944VF6S,anker,3.0 out of 5 stars Great Speaker but not long life span,Kerry Deloach,3,I’ve had this Anker speaker for about 2 years now. It’s been my absolute favorite speaker. I’ve loved it even more than brand new ones. Yesterday it just out of no where stopped working. I’ve charged it up all day & the blue light blinks on no sound comes out anymore. My husband and I have done everything possibly we could try to get it back working but no luck and no I don’t see how the speakers could have blown because it was not even being used (far as sound being disturbed through it when it stopped working). I guess we will just have to throw it out but I’m very sad as it’s not a cheap speaker and I have absolutely loved it for the last 2 years.

R19P3FU5DOT34J,B09944VF6S,anker,3.0 out of 5 stars Just ok,Mattie M.,3,"I got this for $27 after Amazon informed me of a recall on the previous model. If you also pay $27, it's a good speaker, but it's worse in several ways than the previous one. It doesn't get as loud, the battery doesn't last as long, and it has an auto shut off that is very annoying. The speaker takes a good 10 seconds to actually start working after connecting, and mutes for a second after unpausing something.The only things that seem improved are *very* slightly better sound quality, that horrific blue light is gone, and it's a better charging port. Which is good, since you'll be plugging it in more frequently.If you have not experienced the previous model, you'll probably like this one. I would never pay full price ($45) for it, though.

I didn't trust them enough, so I refused their offer.
