Not a boom box for $300 dollars.I bought 3 different speakers after too much time researching around $70.00 that were supposed to have a “Great Bass” sound. Best of the 3. Return other 2 for free within 30 days.The first one arrived in a small hard case and inside was a speaker about the size of an egg. It’s good for a bathroom or office desk. It was about half the volume of the other two and average bass. 3rd place.The second one wasn’t a brick. Good sounding speaker overall. Lacks a little in bass, but a really good sounding speaker for the money.I went with this speaker because you can increase the bass after you get their free app. Best bass of the 3 tested. You can change the equalizer to several different sound options on the app and you can really hear the difference. It sounds great in the garage and I was surprised how far the sound travels outdoors at the Cruz nights. For its size and cost I think it really sounds good even at full volume. Doesn’t distort. Haven’t timed how long it lasts at full volume, but it’s got to be around 8 hours or more?I bought a total of three of them for my garage since you can pair them and they sound awesome even at 1/2 volume.I got them on sale for $29.99ea On Amazon.
