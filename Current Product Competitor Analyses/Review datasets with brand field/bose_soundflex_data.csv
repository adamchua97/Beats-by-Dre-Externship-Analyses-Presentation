R1L85I0ZO92CZP,B0D6WD2QSQ,Bose,5.0 out of 5 stars A Balanced Portable Blue Tooth Speaker.,Norman C. Hunter,5,"I just got the Flex BT speaker in today. I tend to place the player on the table in front of the couch so for me music sounds at moderate volumes. The Flex is quite balanced. The app from Bose allows user adjustable equalization but in my experience EQ is of limited benefit due to the laws of physics. The design of the unit is the main determinate of sound balance so I have just left the EQ flat. This evening I am listening to Mark Knopfler's Sailing To Philadelphia. The bass is good but does not over helm the voices and instruments. The presentation is not fatiguing. The voices are well balanced. This speaker can reveal short comings of recordings so I suppose the EQ can come in handy. The treble is pretty clean. In short, The Bose Soundlink Flex is pretty musical and avoids the boxy sound that other portable players often have. I feels that it is a good purchase at a good price.

As expected the sound is fantastic, more so than any other speaker in it‚Äôs price range. It works great and I can hear it all over my first floor.The problem‚Ä¶.. is the Bluetooth. It connects fine however it always wants to connect. I will be listening to my EarPods and all of a sudden the sound is gone. Well it‚Äôs playing on the bose. I can be upstairs, or working out in the garage or even outside it will hook up by itself and I have to stop and reconfigure. This is not fun for those people who may be watching tv and are all of a sudden assaulted by heavy metal music blasting on the bose. I have tried shutting off the speaker and it will at some point power on and connect. There is nothing on the app they have you download that stops this. I have researched online and I am not the only one that reports this issue. This is annoying enough for me to want to send it back. Hopefully bose will look into this issue and have some way to disable it until I want to use it. Otherwise it‚Äôs more of a hassle than it‚Äôs worth. It‚Äôs a shame because the sound quality really is that good. Read more","Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2024",AEP6M7IIFBQXYQVG6C3RWXB2HUYQ,FALSE,1,{}
