R3UHPD69SUVF4D,B09GJVTRNZ,JBL,5.0 out of 5 stars Incredible Sound and Performance – A Must-Have Speaker!,Seva,5,"I recently bought the JBL Flip 6 Portable Bluetooth Speaker, and I am absolutely blown away by its performance! This speaker delivers powerful sound with deep bass that fills the room, making it perfect for any occasion. Whether I'm using it at home, outdoors, or while traveling, the sound quality remains impressive.The IPX7 waterproof feature is a game-changer. I’ve taken it to the beach and even used it by the pool without worrying about splashes or rain. It's incredibly durable and can handle any environment, which is perfect for outdoor adventures.The 12 hours of playtime is another standout feature. Whether it's a long day at the park or a road trip, I never have to worry about charging it constantly. And when I want to take things up a notch, JBL PartyBoost lets me pair it with other JBL speakers for an even bigger sound experience—ideal for parties and get-togethers.The Teal color is a sleek and modern touch, and it’s a compact size, making it easy to carry around without sacrificing performance. I couldn’t be happier with this purchase and highly recommend the JBL Flip 6 to anyone looking for an amazing portable speaker with superior sound quality, durability, and convenience.

It's nice and loud and clear. The only downside is that it doesn't have a low battery warning feature. You essentially have to keep checking the app to see what the status is. There isn't a beep or a notification in the app to let you know that you need to charge it. Also, it takes a little while to charge up too. I haven't been able to keep it playing while it's plugged in. So there's that too. Either way, I'm happy with it.

R3UHPD69SUVF4D,B09GJZKQ3K,JBL,5.0 out of 5 stars Incredible Sound and Performance – A Must-Have Speaker!,Seva,5,"I recently bought the JBL Flip 6 Portable Bluetooth Speaker, and I am absolutely blown away by its performance! This speaker delivers powerful sound with deep bass that fills the room, making it perfect for any occasion. Whether I'm using it at home, outdoors, or while traveling, the sound quality remains impressive.The IPX7 waterproof feature is a game-changer. I’ve taken it to the beach and even used it by the pool without worrying about splashes or rain. It's incredibly durable and can handle any environment, which is perfect for outdoor adventures.The 12 hours of playtime is another standout feature. Whether it's a long day at the park or a road trip, I never have to worry about charging it constantly. And when I want to take things up a notch, JBL PartyBoost lets me pair it with other JBL speakers for an even bigger sound experience—ideal for parties and get-togethers.The Teal color is a sleek and modern touch, and it’s a compact size, making it easy to carry around without sacrificing performance. I couldn’t be happier with this purchase and highly recommend the JBL Flip 6 to anyone looking for an amazing portable speaker with superior sound quality, durability, and convenience.

It's nice and loud and clear. The only downside is that it doesn't have a low battery warning feature. You essentially have to keep checking the app to see what the status is. There isn't a beep or a notification in the app to let you know that you need to charge it. Also, it takes a little while to charge up too. I haven't been able to keep it playing while it's plugged in. So there's that too. Either way, I'm happy with it.

I experienced the same issues many others have, ultimately leading to me returning the item.1. Speaker does not hold charge past 10% – even after troubleshooting with several different wall ports, the manufacturer’s cable, and third-party cables, the speaker refuses to charge past 10%, no matter the duration of charging.2. Speaker does not stay on while plugged-in – this is a deal breaker for me. I figured i would still use the speaker, just always plugged in. To my surprise, the (plugged in) unit turned off after several minutes of use.3. Sound Quality – there is a noticeable amount of “floor noise,” “surface noise,” “distortion,” “crackling,” and/or “static” when the volume level is any lower than let’s say 40%.
