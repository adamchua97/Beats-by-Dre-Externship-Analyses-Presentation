Hard to get volume adjusted to sweet spot where it's not brassy - too loud or not too whisper soft. Worst defect is that it intermittently - constantly loses the bluetooth connection even when phone is right next to it and battery is 90%. (Phone streams to other devices perfectly.)

If I move my cellphone with my music app more than 5 feet away, it starts to give static sound. Also, even if I'm right by the speaker with the cell phone, if I start to use other apps, it gives static sound to the music.2. When I get a call and pick up while music is playing from the app on my phone, I have an issue. After the call, when I start to play the music again and try to connect Bluetooth from my cell phone, the speaker had already been turned off after like 5 minutes of inactivity. So, I have to go over to the speaker, touch the back of the speaker to find the tiny little power button to turn on the power again.Bass could have been better, but it is not so bad. It has pretty good bass compared to playing music on the cellphone. But the sound overall isn't very clear--it sort of have the closed sound.
